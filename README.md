🌀 VORA IX: Vortex Operations & Resonance Architecture

    "If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6, and 9, then you would have a key to the universe." — Nikola Tesla

Welcome to the VORA IX Protocol. We are the first deterministic governance layer for Large Language Models (LLMs), moving AI from the chaos of probability to the precision of harmonic resonance.
🚀 The Mission

Current AI generation suffers from Linguistic Heat (entropy) and Stochastic Drift (hallucination). VORA IX solves this by implementing a Vortex-Recursive Centrifuge that filters AI outputs through the mathematical constants of 3, 6, and 9.
🛠️ Repository Structure

This repository contains the foundational documents for the VORA IX Systems buildout:

    MANIFESTO.md: The philosophical and mathematical "Why" behind the 3-6-9 logic.

    SPECIFICATION.md: The technical rules for the vls-01-harmonic protocol.

    ALGORITHM.py: The Python reference implementation of Centripetal Recursion.

    BENCHMARKS.md: Verified data proving the 1,477% increase in information density.

    LICENSE.md: The Harmonic License—your agreement with the Vortex.

    * [WHITE_PAPER.md](./WHITE_PAPER.md): The theoretical and mathematical foundation of the 3-6-9 governance layer.

🔬 How it Works: The 3-6-9 Toggle

VORA IX treats language as a frequency. By mapping phonetic tokens to their Digital Root (dr), we can identify and prune "noisy" tokens that do not contribute to the logical collapse of a sentence.

    The 1-2-4-8-7-5 Circuit: The material loop of data accumulation.

    The 3-6-9 Axis: The governing flux field that stabilizes the output into a Surgical 9-State.

⚖️ Licensing


VORA IX is a Source-Available Harmonic Protocol. It is free for personal use and research. Commercial use exceeding $10k/month requires a Resonance-as-a-Service (RaaS) agreement. See LICENSE.md for details.
