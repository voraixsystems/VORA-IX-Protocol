📂 Document 8: The VORA IX Development Roadmap

File Name: ROADMAP.md
Phase 1: The Seed (3) - Community & Tooling

    VLS Linter: Develop a VS Code extension that highlights "High Entropy" code in real-time based on Digital Root analysis.

    Phonetic Mapping Library: Expand ALGORITHM.py to support multi-language phonetic-to-vortex dictionaries (Sanskrit, Greek, Latin).

    Community Initiation: Establish the "Vortex Council" for peer review of harmonic logic.

Phase 2: The Structure (6) - Integration

    LLM Wrappers: Create plug-and-play wrappers for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Llama that "centrifuge" every API response through the 3-6-9 gate before displaying it to the user.

    VBS-9 Dashboard: Build a web-based visualizer to show the "Logical Heat" of a standard LLM conversation vs. a VORA-Verified one.

    Resonance-as-a-Service (RaaS) Beta: Launch the first private API for enterprise partners to test non-stochastic inference.

Phase 3: The Absolute (9) - The VORA Kernel

    Standalone VORA-Small (VS-1): Train a micro-model from scratch using the 3-6-9 constraint as a core loss function, rather than an external governor.

    Zero-Entropy Real-Time API: Public launch of the VORA IX API.

    Vortex Hardware Specification: Theoretical white paper on "3-6-9 Optimized Chips" that utilize modular arithmetic at the transistor level.
