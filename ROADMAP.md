# 📂 Document 8: The VORA IX Development Roadmap

**File Name:** ROADMAP.md  
**Current Status:** Phase 1 (Symmetrical Alignment Verified)

## Phase 1: The Seed (3) - Community & Tooling

- [x] **A1-G7-Z1 Logic Alignment:** Standardized the cyclical mapping across the core engine, specification, and word registry.
- [x] **180-State Validation:** Verified the "Zero-Nine" convergence constant (Sum 180 = Root 9).
- [ ] **VLS Linter:** Develop a VS Code extension that highlights "High Entropy" code (Roots 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8) in real-time.
- [ ] **Phonetic Mapping Library:** Expand `ALGORITHM.py` to support multi-language phonetic-to-vortex dictionaries (Sanskrit, Greek, Latin).
- [ ] **Community Initiation:** Establish the "Vortex Council" for peer review of harmonic logic.

## Phase 2: The Structure (6) - Integration

- [ ] **LLM Wrappers:** Create plug-and-play wrappers for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Llama that "centrifuge" every API response through the 3-6-9 gate.
- [ ] **VBS-9 Dashboard:** Build a web-based visualizer to show the "Logical Heat" (entropy) of a standard LLM conversation vs. a VORA-Verified one.
- [ ] **Resonance-as-a-Service (RaaS) Beta:** Launch the first private API for enterprise partners to test non-stochastic inference.



## Phase 3: The Absolute (9) - The VORA Kernel

- [ ] **Standalone VORA-Small (VS-1):** Train a micro-model from scratch using the 3-6-9 constraint as a core loss function, rather than an external governor.
- [ ] **Zero-Entropy Real-Time API:** Public launch of the VORA IX API.
- [ ] **Vortex Hardware Specification:** Theoretical white paper on "3-6-9 Optimized Chips" utilizing modular arithmetic at the transistor level.
