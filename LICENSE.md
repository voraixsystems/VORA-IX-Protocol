Any system utilizing this code or the VORA IX logic must:
a) Retain the Nikola Tesla 3-6-9 attribution in all core logic headers.
b) Utilize Modular-9 (n mod 9) as the primary verification gate for output validation.
c) Explicitly label outputs as "VORA-Verified" if they reach the 9-State.

## 4. COMMERCIAL LIMITATIONS
Commercial use (any use resulting in gross revenue exceeding $10,000 USD/month) 
requires a separate "Resonance-as-a-Service" (RaaS) Agreement.
