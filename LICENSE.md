# VORA IX HARMONIC LICENSE (Version 1.1)

Copyright (c) 2026 Douglas McClurg Jr / VORA IX Systems

## 1. PREAMBLE
This license governs the use of the Vortex Operations & Resonance Architecture (VORA IX). This protocol is dedicated to the elimination of linguistic entropy through the application of the Tesla 3-6-9 constants and the A1-G7-Z1 cyclical mapping.

## 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
Permission is granted to use, modify, and distribute this software for personal and non-commercial research. All derivative works must maintain the "Harmonic Constraint."

## 3. THE HARMONIC CONSTRAINT
Any system utilizing this code or the VORA IX logic must:
a) Retain the Nikola Tesla 3-6-9 attribution in all core logic headers.
b) Utilize the A1-G7-Z1 Symmetrical Mapping for all phonetic-to-numeric conversions.
c) Apply the Digital Root Operator dr(n) = 1 + ((n-1) mod 9) as the primary verification gate.
d) Maintain the 180-State Convergence Constant for the primary numerical set (zero through nine).
e) Explicitly label outputs as "VORA-Verified" only if they resolve to the 9-State.

## 4. COMMERCIAL LIMITATIONS
Commercial use (any use resulting in gross revenue exceeding $10,000 USD/month) requires a separate "Resonance-as-a-Service" (RaaS) Agreement. Contact the Licensor for terms.

## 5. TERMINATION
This license is automatically revoked if the software is used to generate deceptive, high-entropy, or intentionally misleading information (Stochastic Hallucination).
